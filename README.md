### Technologies

The technologies central to my project will be JavaScript, Canvas, and CSS. I have not, as of yet, found any possibly helpful libraries, but will keep my eyes open.

### Timeline

Day 1: Generate the tunnel on canvas, get it rotating, opening screen
Day 2: Missile movement, and obstacle movement
Day 3: Lives, positioning, music, levels
